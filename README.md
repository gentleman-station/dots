# dotFiles
My personal favorite [dot] files which I would love to share



**NOTE**: Make sure you've got a few stuff before you're expecting things to work out of the box

##### Stuff you'll need

- neofetch
- antibody
- lsd
- neovim


**NOTE**: If some shell commands like `cat`, `less`, etc. are bugging you please add a backslash `\` before the command. Making it look like `\cat > lulz << EOF`
