# dots

Out personal favorite [dot] files which we would love to share ❤️

#### **UPDATE**: You may now use `./install.sh` to easily install these dot files. (Make sure you exit the shell after p10k-config since there's something still remaining, and then you can enjoy your shell via `$ chsh`)

**NOTE**: Make sure you've got a few stuff before you're expecting things to work out of the box

##### Stuff you'll need

- [zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH)
- [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/binary/#binary-install)
- [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch)
- [antibody](https://getantibody.github.io/)
- [lsd](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd)
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat#installation)
- [chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma) / pygmentize (I personally don't recommand pygmentize, hence search and find it yourself and you also need to edit `misc.zsh`'s golbal variable `ZSH_COLORIZE_TOOL` to `pygmentize` for using it.)
- [neovim](https://neovim.io/)
- [xclip](https://github.com/astrand/xclip)
- [Any NerdFonts (Personal recommendation: FiraCode Nerd Font {with ligatures turned on!})](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)*

**NOTE**: If some shell commands like `cat`, `less`, etc. are bugging you please add a backslash `\` before the command. Making it look like `\cat > test_filename << EOF`

\*You may also use any other **supported / **powerline**** font(s) too 🙂
